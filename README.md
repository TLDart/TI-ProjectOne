# Information Theory Project 1
This project was made using Matlab and covers:
* Entropy Analysis over different sources
* Huffman codes
* Group Huffman codes
* Mutual information applied to pattern recognition

# Lore
Every other file stems from main, there, for each file:
* Entropy is calculated;
* Histogram is drawn;
* Huffman codes (both single and to n-th order (we just did the 2 order) are calculated;
Finally, for each "target image":
* Mutual is calculated based on previous function;
* An algorithm is run to identify the the zone that as the biggest mutual information;

# Known Issues/Bugs 
* Massive Slowdown in performance if, when calculating frequency, an alphabet is used
